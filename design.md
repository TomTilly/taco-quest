# Taco Quest Game Design

## Summary

Classic snake game with a multiplayer twist...and tacos!

- Each player controls a snake in an arena/level
- Snakes fight for tacos that spawn
- When a snake eats a taco, it grows longer

## Ideas

- Koopa shell-esque item to slow down other player
- Each player can bite the other player's tail and sever it
- Players can pass underneath their own tail when moving perpendicular to it
- How can we make the snake pooping a game mechanic ? Maybe a way for the snake to shrink ?
- Arrow keys allow you to control a second snake on one computer
