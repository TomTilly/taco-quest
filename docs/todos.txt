BUGS
- Windows seems to be, unhelpfully, optimizing out portions of the game update logic(!):
    -- Affects only test application.

TODO
- Figure out client side lag and potentially do network actions more frequently (outside of game tick) to reduce client lag

HOMEWORK
- Research Steam networking code. There may be security restrictions

NOTES
- Logging updates
    - Game tick + timestamp for:
        - Client sends input
        - Client receives game state
        - Server receives input
        - Server sends game state
