BUGS
- Windows seems to be, unhelpfully, optimizing out portions of the game update logic(!):
    -- Affects only test application.
- Client disconnect assertion failure (net_destroy_socket) after server
  quits while client is still running.
- There is some kind of bug with killing a non-unfurled snake and it being invisible with a length of 1.

TODO
- Figure out client side lag and potentially do network actions more frequently (outside of game tick) to reduce client lag
- When run in server mode, wait until client connects before starting game

HOMEWORK
- Research Steam networking code. There may be security restrictions

NOTES
- Logging updates
    - Game tick + timestamp for:
        - Client sends input
        - Client receives game state
        - Server receives input
        - Server sends game state
