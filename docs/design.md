# Taco Quest Game Design

## Summary

Classic snake game with a multiplayer twist...and tacos!

- Each player controls a snake in an arena/level
- Snakes fight for tacos that spawn
- When a snake eats a taco, it grows longer

## Ideas

- Koopa shell-esque item to slow down other player
- Each player can bite the other player's tail and sever it
- Players can pass underneath their own tail when moving perpendicular to it
- How can we make the snake pooping a game mechanic ? Maybe a way for the snake to shrink ?
- Arrow keys allow you to control a second snake on one computer
- Snake gets item to speed up/slow down time for oneself or all players
- Easter egg for players who use port 6969

## 1/26 Brainstorming Session

Competative coop
Severing tail -> turns back into apples which either opponent can eat
Colliding into a wall:
- no consequence (just stop)
- or, die, respawn at original len, body turns to apples (opportunity to recover len)
door requires two (or more?) buttons simult. to open
- short: impossible (without coop!) long: possible
- maybe area of level that has good stuff, only accessible to a long snake
Apples don't spawn randomly: they "grow", required one to make plans
Apples really are random:
- 1/3: get lucky
- 1/3: unlucky (spawns near the other player)
- 1/3: both are same distance: race
Apples spawn both randomly and with 'growing' version
Level wraps around?
power-up that enables tail snipping (otherwise normal snake mechanic: die when hitting other)
Penalty if you get snipped
Penalty for the snipper: momentary freeze
low amount of food spawns: more in frequent
speed power, but become snippable
