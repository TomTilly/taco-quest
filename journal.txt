Past:
- Justin last made the windows build succeed, but it doesn't work in any way.

Today:
- Justin started by actually fixing windows code
- Tom T followed instructions from Tom F and Justin to begin implementing network platform layer

Future:
- Next up: Tom F
- Finish implementing network platform layer
- Do network actions more frequently (outside of game tick) to reduce client lag

Notes:
- We decided to implement the lowest level wrapper around the socket APIs as opposed to wrapping all of the network and game logic. Reasons:
    - We don't want to have to write the game logic for each platform
    - Reusability for future projects (potentially)
- Windows has special WSAStartup init code that's required
- Setting up client is identical on both platforms
- Setting up server only differs in setting socket to non-blocking
- Interface should handle would block stuff if you set the socket to non-blocking
- Provide conversion layer to provide errors to the user
- Ideas for interface
    - Move INVALID_SOCKET into interface
    - Unify socket type
    - Setup client socket function
        - Params: IP, port
    - Setup server socket function
        - Params: port, (blocking - maybe include later)
    - Send
        - Params: socket, pointer, size
        - Returns: sent, error
        - Basic and loop versions
    - Receive
        - Params: socket, pointer, size
        - Returns: received, error
        - Basic and loop versions
    - Close
    - Accept
        - Params: socket
        - Returns: unified socket, error
